What else is it possible to do with LED lights within an IoT application framework? The answer is simple but comes in the form of another question:There is a rich seam of application potential for public lighting. The basics run much the same as home or business lighting - remote controlled, flexible lighting systems for turning lights on or off, and dimming them. However, some potential is being explored as to brighten lights around the scene of an accident-surely there is scope therefore for an application which links an authority’s lighting control with first respondent and emergency services.
